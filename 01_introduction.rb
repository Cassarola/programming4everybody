# Overview of *Ruby*:
# - Created by "Matz" in 1995
# - Super easy to pick up, @yukihiro_matz wanted a language that emphasized human needs over those of computers, and
#   makes Ruby as close as possible to plain english
# - 10 years later, in 2005, @dhh creates Ruby on Rails, an incredibly powerful framework ("extension" of a language)
#   to build applications, used nowadays by a lot of companies (including Github, Codecademy, Airbnb, and many more)
# - At Le Wagon we teach Ruby and Rails and how to build any web app you can think of! This course is just Ruby though,
#   but you can read more and apply at https://lewagon.com
#
# Let's see Ruby in action!
